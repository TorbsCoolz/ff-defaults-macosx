# ff-defaults-macosx
A collection of Firefox configuration files that I use (made with both ffprofiler and librefox), easily installed on a Mac OS X system.
TO INSTALL
1. Run "brew install firefox"
2. Add profiles.ini and Profiles folder (from the ffprofiler.zip archive) to /Users/<yourusername>/Library/Application Support/Firefox You will have to replace the folder and file already in this location
3. START FIREFOX. Installation of librefox will fail if you do not.
4. QUIT FIREFOX
5. Head to "/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources"
6. Copy the defaults, distribution, and mozilla.cfg directories and folders into "/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources"
7. IF FIREFOX DOES NOT START, try again. Make sure you started firefox before installing librefox
